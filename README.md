Project Problem Statement:
With the growing number of electric vehicles (EVs) on the UMBC campus, students, faculty, and staff increasingly struggle to find available charging stations. At present, there is no centralized system that allows users to conveniently view the locations of EV chargers AND check their real-time availability. This lack of information results in wasted time, unnecessary driving around campus, and inefficient use of charging resources. To solve this problem, this project will develop a software application that features an interactive map displaying all EV charging stations on campus along with their current status that shows whether they’re occupied or available. 

The system aims to enhance campus sustainability initiatives, minimize driver frustration, and encourage the continued adoption of electric vehicles by improving access to charging infrastructure.
