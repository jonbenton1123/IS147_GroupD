Project Problem Statement
Soccer teams often face challenges managing schedules, availability, and communication. Coaches and players rely on group chats, 
paper notes, and scattered reminders, which can lead to confusion about practice plans, game times, bus departures, and lineups.
The Soccer Team Organizer will:
•	Let coaches create practice schedules with detailed content (warm-ups, drills, conditioning).
•	Track pre-season blocks, conditioning, and fitness training results.
•	Provide a game schedule with bus departure times and reminders.
•	Allow coaches to build game lineups with starters and substitutes.
•	Enable players to mark availability (Yes/No/Maybe) for practices and games.
•	Record attendance and performance tracking for long-term progress.

This project solves the problem of disorganized team communication by putting all essential information in 
one central platform, helping coaches plan better and players stay informed and accountable.
